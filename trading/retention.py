"""Keep only the last N trading sessions of data on disk.

The dashboard is a working screen, not an archive: five sessions is what you
actually read, and an unbounded ledger makes every query and page load slower
for data nobody opens.

**This deletes.** Pruning is irreversible, so it is deliberate about scope:

  * trades are kept by SESSION, not by calendar day — counting calendar days
    would silently eat a session across a long weekend or an exchange holiday;
  * rejections and the LLM audit log are cut at the timestamp of the oldest
    session kept, so a row is never orphaned from the trades it explains;
  * the report and candle-cache files follow the same window.

Run it:

    .venv/bin/python -m trading.retention --dry-run      # show what would go
    .venv/bin/python -m trading.retention                # prune to RETENTION_DAYS
    .venv/bin/python -m trading.retention --keep-days 10
