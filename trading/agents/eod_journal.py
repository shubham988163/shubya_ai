"""End-of-day journal analyst (Role 3) — run by cron at 4:00 PM IST.

Dumps the day's ledger (trades, rejections, stats, supervisor verdicts) to the
agent and asks for pattern analysis: recurring mistakes, rule violations, and
the single highest-impact change for tomorrow. Output is saved as a markdown
report in reports/YYYY-MM-DD.md.

This is the highest-ROI, lowest-risk agent role — it never touches the
trading path at all.

## 2) What Worked
* Intraday setup rules executed according to strict risk kernel parameters.
* Real-time zero-delay live broker feeds ensured accurate entries and stops.

## 3) Recurring Mistakes & Rule Violations
* Intraday positions must square-off before 15:15 IST to prevent carrying overnight risk into next session.

## 4) Slippage & Execution Quality
* Fills simulated with standard 0.05% slippage model and full Zerodha statutory charge schedules.

## 5) The Highest-Impact Change For Tomorrow
* Trade only high-scoring (70+) setups that align with the broader market regime."""
