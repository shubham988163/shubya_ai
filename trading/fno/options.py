"""Call options for a qualifying long setup (§ beyond the futures spec).

What NSE actually serves us decides what this can honestly do. The full option
chain endpoints (`option-chain-equities`, `option-chain-v3`) answer `{}` to
programmatic clients — a soft block, not an error — so there is **no chain per
stock**. What is live is the *20 most-active stock option contracts* board,
market-wide. So:

  * a candidate gets an option view only if its contracts are in that board,
    which is a minority of names. Everything else says "no live option data",
    never a guessed strike or premium;
  * no bid/ask and no implied volatility are published there, so no greeks are
    computed and none are shown. Nothing here is modelled — every number is a
    field NSE returned.

The one number that matters most is **breakeven = strike + premium**. A call
only pays if the stock clears that by expiry, and it routinely sits *above* the
scanner's own 1:2 target on the underlying — meaning the stock setup can work
perfectly and the call still expire worthless. That comparison is computed for
every strike and is the reason a strike gets rejected.
