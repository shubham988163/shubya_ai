"""Trade-quality rejection rules (§15).

These are hard gates applied *after* scoring: a candidate that trips any of
them is not emitted as a trade regardless of how well it scored. Scoring
ranks; filters veto. Keeping the two separate means a 91-point setup with
contradictory OI is visibly rejected rather than quietly ranked below others.

Each veto is tagged with a category so the UI can separate "hasn't set up yet"
(structure, timing, risk) from "the evidence argues against it" (OI, market,
sector, VWAP, volume, liquidity, data). Only the former can leave a stock on
the watch list.
